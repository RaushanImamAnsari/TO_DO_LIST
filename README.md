# TO_DO_LIST


This is a to-do web app I have designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is useful for maintaining and creating your tasks for the entire day.<br>
 
This app can do the following things:<br>

--> You can create your tasks.<br>
--> You can check them off after they are done.<br>
--> You can easily remove and add another task.<br>
--> The app stores all your data in the local browser so that you can track your tasks.<br>
